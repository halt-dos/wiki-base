# Stacks

Collection of resources for logical association with organization's ongoing projects

---

Think of a Stack as a collection of services and settings that you create for a project or website. Many customers use just one Stack. If you manage multiple web properties that you'd like to track separately or require a different set of tools, then creating multiple stacks is the way to go.

Stacks form the basis for creating, enabling, and using all Haltdos services including managing APIs, enabling billing, adding and removing collaborators, and managing permissions for your resources.

**Stack Types**

The following are the types of the stack that the platform supports:

1. **BYOL / SELF-HOSTED**: In Bring Your Own License (BYOL) stack, the infrastructure required for hosting Web Application Firewall (WAF) is done by the customer. BYOL stack can be hosted on any public cloud or private machine (Virtualized or Hardware) or can be bought from Marketplaces of various cloud providers. All resources in the BYOL stack can still subscribe to other apps (CDN, DNS, etc.) and Haltdos team will provide the infrastructure for them. Monthly payments are applicable.
2. **ENTERPRISE**: In this type of stack, dedicated infrastructure is created for managing web properties for the customer. This stack uses dedicated instances for running workloads for a single customer. Provisioning of infrastructure, networking, etc. for managing all the web properties associated with this stack is managed 24x7 by the Haltdos team. Monthly payments are applicable for CDN and DNS services.

**Stack Creation**

A stack is equivalent to a license in the traditional appliance. In order to get started, please contact Haltdos Support to create a new stack. Upon creating a stack, the user can add zone and instances to it.

**To Create a stack**

In order to create a new stack, please contact **support@haltdos.com**.

Once the stack has been issued, the user can view the stack in the haltdos console. To access your stack,

1. Login to your Haltdos account.
2. Click on the **username** at the top right side and click on **My Stack** in the drop-down menu.

**Stack Subscriptions**

After the creation of the stack, the stack will be subscribed to all Apps issued to the stack.

- Haltdos provides various Apps like WAF, CDN, DNS, SCAN.
- Apps can be accessed from stack Overview at the left side navigation menu.
- Haltdos provides a feature that can be accessed on the basis of the stack app. For example, If a user wants one domain in one app like ADC and another domain for another app like CDN, he can create a domain for the respective Apps.

Note: There are limits on the number of Stacks per account, number of Zones per Stack, and App level limits depending on your plan. Please contact support for knowing and increasing the limits for your account.
