# Apps

Haltdos service subscribed to a specific stack

---

Haltdos Cloud offers various services called apps which subscribed to each stack. These apps allow you to selectively choose the service you need for delivering or securing your websites.

Apps are used to deliver Haltdos's features at your convenience and they are easy to use too. Apps can be used on multiple websites in conjunction with each other or individually.  Each App can be configured individually, allowing you more control over how to protect and deliver your website to the audience you wish to cater your services to.

Each App is detailed in its own way hence they are listed in separate sections.
