# Error Rules
Error Rule & Settings

Error Rules is a feature of Haltdos SLB that allows application owners to show custom pages without revealing internal exceptions generated by the application upon failure. The custom pages can be created for specific HTTP error codes respectively and thus be used with the error rules.
