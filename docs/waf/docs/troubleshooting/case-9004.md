# Configuring Maintenance Mode 

---

## Case: 9004

### Problem Statement

The client has to put the website in maintenance mode, and wants to ensure that his/her custom designed page should be displayed.

### Solution

**Steps to Solve**

The client can achieve the above scenario by implementing the error rules feature of WAF.

As you can notice, we have created another error rule for this scenario, here we have a different custom error page and 5xx error code.

The client can use this feature to mask its 5XX HTTP error code with custom designed error pages, mainly helpful in cases of scheduled maintenance routines.
