In this way user can select any of the operational mode from the three mode available.

MITIGATION: In this mode, all the mitigation & rule sets will monitor the traffic. If any request matches the criteria, it gets dropped.

BYPASSED: In this mode, all the requests get bypassed without any filtration of mitigation & rule sets.

RECORD: In this mode, all the mitigation & rule sets will monitor the traffic. If any request is about to drop, then it gets captured and forwarded in the form of a Record Event
