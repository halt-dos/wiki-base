##### **Outgoing Interface**

This option allows the user to select the outgoing interface from which the packets will move.

##### **Gateway IP**

A gateway is a network node that serves as an access point to another network. This option allows user to set their gateway IP address. IP can be set in a format like 192.168.0.1

##### **Enabled NAT**

This option allows users to enable or disable NAT. NAT is a method of mapping an IP address space into another by modifying network address information in the IP header of packets. If there is any NAT rule already configured by the user, the source or destination IPs address will be mapped accordingly. If there is no such NAT rule added by the user, then the user can add a new rule for Network Address Translation.
