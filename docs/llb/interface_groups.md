Interface Group is a grouping mechanism of physical Interfaces configured on Link Load Balancer including LAN & WAN. Users can create, modify, delete interface groups, and set desired monitor types for each interface group.

High availability (HA) is the ability of a system to operate continuously without failure for a designated period of time. HA works to ensure a system meets an agreed-upon operational performance level. High availability (HA) is usually required in a system where there is high demand for a little downtime. Haltdos LLB has the option of a logical grouping of physical interfaces for a highly available WAN connectivity structure.
