# SSL VPN

---

An SSL VPN is a type of virtual private network (VPN) that uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol -- or, more often, its successor, the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol -- in standard web browsers to provide secure, remote access VPN capability.
It enables devices with an internet connection to establish a secure remote access VPN connection with a web browser. The Haltdos SSL-VPN connection uses end-to-end encryption (E2EE) to protect data transmitted between the endpoint device client software and the SSL VPN server through which the client connects securely to the internet.  

Haltdos SSL VPN allows user to configure VPN using following options: 

1. [**Settings**](docs/settings)
2. [**VPN Users**](vpn-users.md)
3. [**VPN Group**](vpn-group.md)
