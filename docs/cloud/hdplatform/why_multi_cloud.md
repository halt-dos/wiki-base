# Why Multi-Cloud?

---

A multi-cloud is a strategy to use two or more cloud computing services in a single heterogeneous architecture. It is a distribution of software, cloud assets, applications, etc. It reduces the reliance on any single cloud provider.

It can use different environments like Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) to gain an overarching business goal. Different providers need not be necessarily connected.

Enterprises deploy a multi-cloud architecture for several reasons. It is readily available for starters. When one cloud goes offline, the other cloud can take charge to achieve the goal. It is scalable, flexible, and customizable. Enterprise can choose the best of each cloud type as per their business economics, needs, timings, and locations.

#### Multi-Cloud Advantages

- **ROI Optimization**: A multi-cloud strategy lets you select the best possible solution for your enterprise. As diverse needs arise, alter, and become more complex, a business can use resources for a particular purpose, exploit those resources and pay as per utility.

- **Improved Security**: Multi-cloud strategy empowers enterprises by optimizing computing resources and by maintaining stringent security compliance. It decreases the risk that a DDoS attack can potentially take mission-critical applications offline. In an event where downtime of a single hour can cost you thousands, improved security pays for itself.

- **Freedom to Choose**: A single cloud provider cannot deliver all essential computing services. Several financial stakeholders are wary of vendor lock-in. In case if there is a better deal with other providers, it becomes tough for a business to move from one architecture to another.

- **Reliable Architecture**: Multi-cloud solutions produce redundancies, which in turn decreases a single point of failure risk. The multi-cloud also reduces the likelihood that a single service failure can offline the entire enterprise. Hybridization adds an extra security layer by preserving sensitive data within a secure, local network.

- **Advanced Disaster Preparedness**: Multiple cloud vendors have extremely low concurrent downtime. Service providers such as Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, and Amazon Web Services have notable service level agreements to ensure client protection against downtime. Leverage two or more of these services to significantly reduce disaster risk.

**Haltdos Cloud Advantages**

Apart from the stated benefits of adopting Multi-Cloud architecture, Haltdos Cloud offers the following additional benefits:

- **Hyper-localization**: Every cloud provider has its reach. It has PoPs (Point of Presence) and data centers around the world. However, the extent of the reach of each cloud provider is limited, meaning some cloud providers can offer greater connectivity in certain regions over others. By leveraging multiple clouds, Haltdos can seamlessly deploy its technology over different cloud service providers to offer hyper-localized deployments much closed to end customers.
- **DDoS Mitigation at Source**: Another great advantage of using multiple cloud providers is in our ability to detect, isolate and localize high volume DDoS attacks for the targeted customer without impacting other customers and users of the targeted customer accessing from regions other than the source of origin of DDoS attack.

- **Economics**: By leveraging multiple cloud providers, Haltdos can negotiate prices, reduce its operational and maintenance cost, which translates into affordable pricing of our services to our customers.
