## How to configure sync?

### Problem Statement

The user wants to configure config sync from Haltdos console for reflecting configuration changes of one machine to other.

### Solution

The client can achieve the above requirement by utilising the NTP Integration under Haltdos WAF.

1. First, log into Haltdos Management Console.

2. Go to **Stacks** > **Integration** > **Config Sync**

![sync](/img/platform/base/sync2.png)

3. Client can configure the config sync by entering information(IP, port, auth key) of peer machine.

:::note
Client can generate auth key by going **Stacks** > **Integration**> **API Token** > **Generate API token**. API key of first machine needs to be entered in second machine for setting communication between the machines.
