5. As client can observe, the redirection rule in SLB is temporarily redirecting traffic that is coming on HTTP site to HTTPS site with the status code of 302, as per the settings made in the redirection rule.

#### **Problem Statement II**

2. As client can observe, they are getting the expected response with status code 301, as per the set configuration.

**Note:** Please ensure to clear your cached data from browser to revert back from permanent redirect, as a local copy gets saved in cache, and will keep redirecting even if the rule is deleted from the SLB GUI.
