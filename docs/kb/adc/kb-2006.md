**Step 2**:- As client can observe, they are getting the expected response with status code 301, as per the set configuration.

**Note: Please ensure to clear your cached data from browser to revert back from permanent redirect, as a local copy gets saved in cache, and will keep redirecting even if the rule is deleted from the SLB GUI**.
