# How to add multiple server groups?

**Problem Statement**

The client application are running on some specific port numbers, so they wanted the request coming with those port numbers are being served by some specific servers.In this case, they can create a new server group and upstream rule. With this request coming with specific source port number should be handled by new server group.

**Solution**

The client can utilize the upstream rules in SLB to add different server groups.

**Step to Solve**

**NOTE**:- Here, we are not able to get the response from the actual server because the end-user request has been served by the default server group.
