As one can observe, the redirection rule in WAF is temporarily redirecting traffic that is coming on HTTP site to HTTPS site with the status code of 302, as per the settings made in the redirection rule.

**Problem Statement  2**

The client requires to have a redirection rule for their HTTP website to HTTPS website with permanent redirection

**Solution**

As you can observe, We are getting the expected response with status code 301, as per the set configuration.

**Note:** Please ensure to clear your cached data from browser to revert back from permanent redirect, as a local copy gets saved in cache, and will keep redirecting even if the rule is deleted from the WAF GUI.
