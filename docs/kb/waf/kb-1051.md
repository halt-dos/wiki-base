As we can see that from above picture the request has been blocked because we specify values or a range of values for various form fields of a web application form also we have to check the incidents to know about the detailed information of blocked request.

4. Go to **Stacks** > **WAF** > **Incidents**.

As we can see that from above picture the content size is 145 and in form rule we configure the rule details by following values

Request validation = Maximum  Body Length

Value = 2 , but here we set the maximum content size by 2 that is the reason the request gets blocked. In this way we can achieve form rule.
