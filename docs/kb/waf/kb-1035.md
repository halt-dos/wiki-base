# How to configure bot protection settings in order to ensure protection from reconnaissance and scraping activities?

**Problem Statement**

The user wants to configure the bot protection settings so that the web application can be safe from reconnaissance and scrapping activities. It's especially important that search engine web crawler bots don't get blocked, because without them a website can't show up in search results. Bad bots can steal data, break into user accounts, submit junk data through online forms, and perform other malicious activities.

**Solution**

1. Firstly, login to WAF.
