# How a user extract or set a custom variable by using Variable Rules in Haltdos WAF?

**Problem Statement**

Client wants a form field to be immutable, then he can create a variable for that field that is going to be immutable. This variable can be used in form validation to check whether the field is immutable or not. If the field is modified, then the request will be dropped

**Solution**

**Steps to Solve**:-

The user can make use of Haltdos WAF Variable rule features.

1. First, log into the haltdos management console.

5. We have to open listener in the browser and refresh the page to check whether the rule is working or not.

As you can see that from above picture request is dropped because we set the condition and value for the listener if the condition gets modify than our request will be drooped and we had also set the custom error page when our request gets drooped and also our drooped request will be recorded in the Incidents because in rule action we choose drop and record request from drop-down box.

6.Now return to the WAF and click on incident report on real-time alerts for various types of incidents from attacks to accounting/audit incidents through Events.
