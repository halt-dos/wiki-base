# How to configure multiple security profiles for complex application ?

**Problem Statement**

The client wants the Application to behave for a set of user in different way or client wants to configure different type of Application behind the WAF.

**Solution**

The client can achieve the above requirement by configuring different profile.

Example :We have DEFAULT [**Profiles**](docs/waf/listener/profiles/profiles.md),in which we configured that application will not handle the POST request using [**Web Policy**](docs/waf/listener/profiles/policy/Web_policy.md)

After Policy is applied,WAF will automatically block the POST request.

And now we are configuring the Profile for another set of users and in which we have configured that it will handle POST request.

After configuring the profile, WAF is allowing the POST request for the same application.

In the same way, the client can configure the Profile for different application types (i.e. websites, web socket).
