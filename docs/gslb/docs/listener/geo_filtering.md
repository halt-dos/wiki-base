## Overview

Geo Filtering is a smart way to limit access to Internet content as per the geographic location of the user. Firstly, we determine the location of the user using the Geo location techniques (such as reviewing the IP address of the user against Whitelist or blacklist, accounts, calculating network connection end-to-end delay to assess the user's physical location).
