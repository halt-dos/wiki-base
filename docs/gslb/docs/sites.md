## Overview

A GSLB site is the logical collection of GSLB virtual server, GSLB service, LB virtual server, etc. A GSLB service identifies a load balancing or content switching virtual server, which can be at the local site or a remote site. If the GSLB virtual server selects a load balancing or content switching virtual server at a remote site, it sends the virtual serverâ€™s IP address to the DNS server. The DNS server sends it to the client. The client then resends the request to the new virtual server at the new IP.
