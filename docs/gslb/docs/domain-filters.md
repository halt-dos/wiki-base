# Domain Filters

---

Domain Filters allows a DNS resolver to modify DNS records. It was originally developed as a way to block access to dangerous websites.  

For example, if a computer queries the IP address of a known dangerous site that spreads malware, the DNS resolver can return NXDOMAIN as the DNS response, so the computer canâ€™t connect to the dangerous site. This is the original use case. As such, Domain Filter is also known as DNS firewall.
