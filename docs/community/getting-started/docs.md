# Haltdos CE Features

- #### **Automated Patches**  

    Automated patches is used to detect components and environment settings to adapt the firewall more efficiently. Endpoint WAF is something that is installed inside your application. It is more aware of the environment of your website than a cloud firewall. Haltdos WAFs have the ability to use your scan report to temporarily patch your application for immediate protection.

**Haltdos WAF** is based on a Negative Security model that protects against known attacks and a Positive Security model that only admits pre-approved traffic. Think of a negative model as a club bouncer instructed to deny admittance to guests who donâ€™t meet the dress code. Now in the positive model, this is like the bouncer at an exclusive party only admitting people who are invited. Both negative and positive have their advantages and drawbacks but when combined together with Artificial Intelligence, **Haltdos WAF** provides comprehensive protection to your website.
