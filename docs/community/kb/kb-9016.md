Users are allowed to customize the listening port for the management console. In the below knowledge base we have taken example of port 8000.

#### **Solution**

The user need to follow below steps to customize the listening port;

1. User need to have CLI access the machine in which we have installed the Haltdos WAF Community Edition.

2. Now, the user needs to use commands below to modify the system file.:

```
nano /etc/systemd/system/controller.service
```
