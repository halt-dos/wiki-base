# Header Rules

### Overview 
We have introduced Header rules by which application owners can manipulate request headers, cookies, and arguments in request as well as response headers. Users can create/update header rules at run time with on-the-fly updates. It has the functionality to add/remove/update any cookie/header/arguments in the request to the web-server(back-end) as well as respond to the client.
