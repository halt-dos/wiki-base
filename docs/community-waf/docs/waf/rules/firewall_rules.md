# Firewall Rules

### Overview
 A Firewall Rule is used to set up regulations on a particular domain. When a request is made to that domain, the WAF checks for the violation of a rule and carries out the appropriate action that is configured by the User.

The following actions are available to the User :
1. **DROP  & RECORD REQUEST** - If the Request to the subscribed domain matches the Firewall Rule, an event is generated but the request will not be allowed through the WAF.
2. **RECORD REQUEST** - An event is generated whenever the Request satisfies the Rule, but whenever the request passes through other rules its events are logged by Haltdos.
3. **BYPASS REQUEST** - If the Request tests positive for the rule, no other rule is tested and the Request will be allowed through the WAF.
4. **REDIRECT** - If the request satisfies the rule, then the user is redirected to another page.
5. **NO ACTION** - If the request satisfies the rule, then no action will be performed on the current request.
