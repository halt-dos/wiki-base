# Remote Access Gateway

---

Haltdos **Remote Access Gateway** is a type of virtual private network (VPN) that uses the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol -- or, more often, its successor, the Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocol -- in standard web browsers to provide secure, remote access VPN capability.
It enables devices with an internet connection to establish a secure remote access VPN connection with a web browser. The Haltdos **Remote Access Gateway** connection uses end-to-end encryption (**E2EE**) to protect data transmitted between the endpoint device client software and the SSL VPN server through which the client connects securely to the internet.  

Haltdos **Remote Access Gateway** allows user to configure VPN using following options: 

1. [**Settings**](settings)
2. [**VPN Users**](vpn-users.md)
3. [**VPN Group**](vpn-group.md)
