# SSL Settings
It provides functionality to support SSL offloading based on configurations.

---

### Overview

As many applications are running over HTTPS, for the WAF / ADC solution to inspect user payload, it is necessary to decrypt SSL/TLS traffic. The following settings allow users to configure SSL offloading based and optional re-encryption in Haltdos solution. The performance of SSL offloading will vary based on chosen model.

### How to Use:

1. Go To **WAF > Listeners > SSL Settings** 
2. Configure Your Settings 
3. Click **Save Changes**. 

#### Encrypt Traffic to Upstream

This specifies WAF should re-encrypt traffic before sending it to the back-end web application. 

:::note
**We can listen to non-HTTPS traffic and send it as HTTPS traffic to the back end server.**

##### **Enable SSL Offloading**
This option specifies if the WAF should enable HTTPS traffic for the configured website.

##### **SSL Certificate**
This field allows us to Select or Upload an SSL Certificate for SSL Offloading in case of encrypted traffic. Users can select the SSL certificate from the drop-down or add a new certificate by clicking the ADD button which will redirect to the SSL Certificates page

##### **SSL Ciphers**
It is a set of algorithms or a set of instructions/steps that helps to establish a secure connection between two entities â€” usually the client (a user's browser) and the web-server they're connecting to (your website). Users can select respective ciphers from the drop-down.

##### **SSL Ciphers Suites**
In order to secure or make SSL compatible with specific web browsers. Users can select from the drop-down i.e. Modern(Very Secure), Intermediate (Recommended),  Old(Backward Compatibility), Custom, etc.

##### **SSL Session Caching**
This option allows users to specify the number of SSL session cache for HTTPS requests on the listener.

##### **SSL Session Timeout**
This option allows users to specify the SSL session timeout in minutes for every HTTPS request on the listener.

##### **Client Certificate Verification**
This option specifies if the solution should enable client certificate authentication.

##### **Client Certificate**
This option specifies an SSL certificate for Client Authentication.

##### **Client Certificate Fingerprint Header**
This option specifies header name for forwarding SSL certificate fingerprint to be upstream

##### **Client Certificate Issuer Header**
This option specifies header name for forwarding SSL Certificate Issuer to be upstream

##### **Client Certificate Subject Header**
It specifies header name for forwarding SSL certificate Subject to be upstream

##### **Client Certificate Serial Header**
This option specifies header name for forwarding SSL certificate Serial to be upstream

##### **Client Certificate Verify Header**
This option specifies header name for forwarding SSL certificate verified to be upstream

##### **Client Certificate Start Date Header**
This option specifies header name for forwarding SSL certificate start date to be upstream

##### **Client Certificate End Date Header**
This option allows user to add header name for forwarding SSL certificate end date to be upstream.

##### **Invalid Client Certificate Action**
This option allows user to specify the action to be performed when client certificate verification fails.
