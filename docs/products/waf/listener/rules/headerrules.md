# Header Rules
Helps to modify headers, cookies, and arguments in the request sent to the back-end server as well as modifying response sent to the client.

---

### Overview 
We have introduced Header rules by which application owners can manipulate request headers, cookies, and arguments in request as well as response headers. Users can create/update header rules at run time with on-the-fly updates. It has the functionality to add/remove/update any cookie/header/arguments in the request to the web-server(back-end) as well as respond to the client.

### How to Use:
1. Go to **WAF** > **Listeners** > **Rules** > **Header Rules**.
2. Click on **Add Rule** and set relevant parameters described below.
3. Click on **Save Changes**

### Description

##### **Rule Name**

Specify a rule name to identify the rule which is to be created. The rule name takes alphanumeric input.

##### **Message**

Specify a rule message containing a detailed description to identify the rule which is to be created.

##### **Rule Priority**

User can define the rule's priority among various other custom error rules.

##### **URI**

Specify the URI or regex for which rule will be applied. 

##### **Method**

Select the HTTP method for the rule to validate when matched with the request.

##### **Rule Action**

The rule action determines what action (add/remove/overwrite) the rule will perform. The accepted values are:

1) **ADD:** This condition will allow adding a value at the specified location.

2) **REMOVE:** This condition will allow removing a value at the specified location.

3) **OVERWRITE:** This condition will allow overwriting a value at the specified location.

If the action is **ADD** then another field is required I.e., **Value** that will be added for the specified **Parameter**.

If the action is **REMOVE**, then the specified parameter is removed.

If the action is **OVERWRITE**, then two other fields are required first is **Search Pattern** (string/regex that should match the existing value) and **Replace** (the string that should be overwritten). We can capture string from the PCRE capturing group using position with a prefix of '$'. 

:::note
 In order to escape the dollar($) character in the replace, add the dollar symbol twice.
