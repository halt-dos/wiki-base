# Upstream Rules 
You can switch between your server groups by creating upstream rules.

## Overview

For example, if a user wants its /API calls to be served by server-group "API" and console by "DEFAULT" then he can create a rule with a search pattern and search location as URL/Header/Cookie/Body/Arguments
