# Load Balancing  

Load Balancing mechanism used for WAF

## Overview 

Load balancing across multiple application instances is a commonly used technique for optimizing resource utilization, maximizing throughput, reducing latency, and ensuring faultâ€‘tolerant configurations.

## Load Balancing Algorithms
This field specifies the load balancing algorithm according to the configured website.

1.**ROUND ROBIN**: 
This algorithm is a smart approach to distribute client requests across an array of servers. It forwards the client request to each server in turn. Also, assigns a weight to each server as per current load and idle capacity.

2.**LEAST CONNECTIONS**: This algorithm is a dynamic load balancing algorithm. It forwards client requests to the server, which has the least no. of active connections on the server.

3.**LEAST LISTENER CONNECTIONS**:
 This algorithm is a dynamic load balancing algorithm. It forwards client requests to the server, which have a small response time in order to serve requests.

4.**LEAST RESPONSE TIME**: This algorithm is a dynamic load balancing algorithm. It forwards client requests to the server, which have a small response time in order to serve requests.

5.**MINIMUM JITTER**: This algorithm is a dynamic load balancing algorithm. It forwards client requests to the server, which have served the minimum jitter. NOTE: For this algorithm to work, the server group should have ICMP monitor attached.

6.**IP HASH**: This algorithm takes the client's and server's source and destination IP address to generate a unique hash key. This key is used to assign the client to a specific server. In the case of a broken session, the key can be regenerated, and the client can be directed to the same server. 

7.**PERSISTENT HASH**: This algorithm takes the user input location within the current request to generate a user-defined custom unique hash key. This key is used to assign the client to a specific server. In the case of a broken session, the key can be regenerated, and the client can be directed to the same server. NOTE: In hashing-based load balancing,  if a specified value does not exists then the request is served on the basis of client's IP address.

8.**Least Requests:**
This algorithm is a dynamic load balancing algorithm. It forwards client requests to the server, which have served the minimum amount of requests.

9.**SNMP Metrics**: This algorithm is a dynamic load balancing algorithm. It forwards client requests to the server, which have least CPU / RAM usage. NOTE: For this algorithm to work, the server group should have SNMP monitor attached.

## Description

1.**Upstream Retries**

This option specify the upstream retries. By default, the value is set to 1.

2.**Fail-over Threshold**

This option specify the fail-over threshold in percentage of (active/total) primary servers for switching to backup servers. By default, the value is set to 50%.

3.**CLIENT IP POOL:**

Specify list of client IP to use when connecting to upstream. Leave blank for auto

4.**Algorithm**

This drop-down specify the algorithm used by the server group. By default, the value is selected as Round Robin.

5.**STICKY SESSION COOKIE:**

Specify enabling sticky session based on specified cookie
