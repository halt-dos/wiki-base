# Incidents
Overview of various incidents and Alerts generated by Haltdos WAF

---

## Overview

Haltdos solutions provide real-time alerts for various types of incidents from attacks to accounting/audit incidents through Events. Events can be generated by the platform and various Apps subscribed to in your Stack. You can view all events or filter them based on category, scope, and time.


#### Events Page

All events are listed on the Events Page. Filters are available to view events of a specific App/Zone/ Listener and Category. Each event is identified by a unique Event ID which can also be used for searching a specific event on the Events Page. All events are listed in decreasing chronological order.

#### Event Details

Depending upon the type of event, clicking on any Event shows details of the incident. For example, a WAF Attack Event will detail the request/response that got dropped along with details of the request and the reason for dropping the request.

Further to detailing the incident through Events, users can perform various actions. For example, virtual patching functionality is implemented through actions in Event Details. Virtual Patching is the ability to create custom WAF rules from the result of a security scan.
