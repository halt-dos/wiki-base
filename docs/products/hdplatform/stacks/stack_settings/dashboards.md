# Dashboards

Cutomize and create new dashboards in Haltdos Platform

---

Haltdos platform allows users to create custom dashboards. Each dashboard can include multiple graphs ( charts, tables and widgets). These dashboards allow users to see what is relevant to them - customized as per their requirements. Reporting also uses dashboards. Hence, reporting alerts can also be customized like dashboards.

:::info
By default, Haltdos solutions come with pre-build dashboards. This module allows users to extend that functionality as per requirements.
