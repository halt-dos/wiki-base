For security reasons, except user creation, deletion, and change of user permission and administrator capabilities, all functionality of GUI can be managed through CLI as well.  

**Enforcement Plane**
Enforcement of policies is done through this plane. This plane connects to Management Plane for retrieving updates, policies. and procedures.  

**Auxiliary Plane**

The Auxiliary Plane manages status and intelligence sharing between multiple instances in the Enforcement Plane. The shared data includes connection status, SSL status, intel status such as blocked IP, state information such as variables, learning, rule staging, etc.
