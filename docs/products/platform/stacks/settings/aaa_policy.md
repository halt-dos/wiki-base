# AAA Policy

Integration with AAA service for securing access to Haltdos appliances

---

AAA is a standard-based framework used to control who is permitted to use network resources (through authentication), what they are authorized to do (through authorization), and capture the actions performed while accessing the network (through accounting).

1. Authentication - The process by which it can be identified that the user, which wants to access the network resources.

2. Authorization - It provides capabilities to enforce policies on network resources after the user has gained access to the network resources through authentication.

3. Accounting - It provides means of monitoring and capturing the events done by the user while accessing the network resources.

Haltdos supports built-in integration AAA solutions such as RADIUS or TACACS+. These services ensure authentication, authorization, and accounting when accessing Haltdos appliances.

:::info
Depending upon the organization's policy, if AAA is enabled, the same should also be configured for Haltdos appliances
