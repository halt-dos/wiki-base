# Backup Policy

Integration with FTP server for backing up and restoration

---

## Overview

Haltdos supports periodic or on-demand backup for storing logs and policies to external FTP / SFTP servers. The platform also supports restoring from FTP if needed.
By default, Haltdos retains logs locally on the device for a duration of 90 days. This duration can be increased to at most 550 days depending upon organization policy.

**Note** It is recommended to configure periodic backup to avoid data loss and ensure log availability for compliance and forensic examination
