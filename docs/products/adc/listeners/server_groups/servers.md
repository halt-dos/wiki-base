### Description:

##### **Server ID**

Server ID is used to identify the upstream servers. It will be always unique for every original/upstream server.

##### **Server**

This option allows users to add the server domain name/IPv4/IPv6 address of the server.

##### **Port**

This option allows users to set the port number that is being used for the server.

##### **Weight**

This option allows users to set the weight value for the server. Server with a higher weight value will get more requests than servers with less weight value.

##### **Back up**

This option allows users to enable or disable the backup server. If the user enables this option, that server will act as a backup server and after the set threshold limit this backup server will start. If the user disabled this option, that server will act as a normal server in the server group.

##### **Mode**

This option allows users to configure the server ready or down setting. 

1. **Ready** - If the user has set the Ready value in this option then server will take part actively in handling the client requests.
2. **Down** - If the user has set the Down value in this option then server will not take part actively in handling the client requests. 
3. **Gracefully Down** - Gracefully Down option will ensure no active connection will be break during the server down activity, server will be handling the old connection until con-current connection count reach to 0. Once con-current connection will be 0 then server will be marked as down at SLB level. Hence, with the help this option, user can gracefully down any server.

##### Forwarded HTTP Version

This option allows user to select HTTP version while forwarding request to the backend server.

##### **Slow Start**
 This option allows users to select the graceful start time for newly added servers.

##### **Max Connection**

The user can define how many maximum connections can be made on this particular server.
