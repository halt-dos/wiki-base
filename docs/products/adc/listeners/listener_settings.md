### **Description**:

#### Enable IPv6

This option allows user to enable traffic over IPv6 and applicable in the case of all service types. Internet Protocol version 6 is the most recent version of the Internet Protocol that allows communication to take place over the network.

#### Enable Http 2.0

This option allows user to specify whether the solution supports HTTP 2.0 request. HTTP/2 aims to be a faster, more efficient protocol than HTTP. Read more about the differences between the two and how you can get started with HTTP2 today.

#### Enable WebSocket

This option allows user to enable web-socket support for servers or server group. It is a communication, an upgraded, quick, and seamless protocol to use when one needs to establish constant client-server communication over a single TCP connection.

#### Enable HTTP Keepalive

This option allows users to enable HTTP Keep-alive for client connections. HTTPKeep-Alive can speed up website as the browser only needs to go through the process of connecting to the server once through a single TCP connection.

#### Enable Device Detection

This option allows users to detect devices and its OS on the client-side in the case of service type HTTP. If the user enabled this option, they can enable the device-based upstream rules.

#### Enable Logging

This option allows user to enable access logs in the case of service type HTTP & TCP.s

#### Log Format

This option allows users to request information to be logged. All logs in JSON format. Users can select from SRC, PORT, COUNTRY, METHODE, URI, UA, UPSTREAM, STATUS, REQUEST / RESPONSE SIZE, DEVICE & OS. All these logs method works for service type HTTP only, SRC, PORT, COUNTRY, & UPSTREAM works for service type TCP only.

#### Client connection Timeout

Connection timeout is a time period within which a connection between a client and a server must be established. This option is only applicable in the case of service type HTTP & TCP. This option allows users to set the connection timeout values from client-side.

#### Client Resume Timeout

This option is only applicable in the case of service type HTTP & TCP. This option allows users to specify the time within which a lost client connection can resume.

#### Max Concurrent Connections

This option is only applicable in the case of service type HTTP & TCP. This option allows users to specify max allowed concurrent connections. By default, Set 0 to disable.

#### Client Keep-Alive Timeout

This option is only applicable in the case of service type HTTP. This option allows users to specify a timeout of keep-alive connections with clients.

#### HTTP Request Timeout

This option is only applicable in the case of service type HTTP. This option allows users to specify client HTTP request timeout.

#### User Session Duration

Users can specify max allowed user session duration in minutes.

#### Session Cookie

This option is only applicable in the case of service type HTTP. This option allows users to specify the session cookie for tracking active users.

#### Max Concurrent User Sessions

This option is only applicable in the case of service type HTTP. This option allows users to specify max allowed concurrent user sessions. Set 0 to disable.

#### Max Session Exceeded Action

Users can specify the action to take when max session count exceeds.

#### MAX Session Forward URL

Users can specify the redirected URL when max session count exceeds.

#### Remote IP Header

This option is only applicable in the case of service type HTTP. This option allows users to specify the header for extracting remote IP.

#### Server Aliases

This option is only applicable in the case of service type HTTP. This option allows users to specify named aliases for this listener.

#### Virtual IPs

This option is only applicable in the case of service type HTTP. This option allows users to specify assigned virtual IPs for accepting traffic.
