# Pattern Score

---

### **Overview**

In today’s networks, cyber-attacks cause damage or theft and disrupt services with enormous economic and financial impacts. Software implementations cannot meet performance goals; a combination of software and hardware can be more effective for high-performance pattern matching. Packet content scanning at high speed has become extremely important due to its applications in network security, network monitoring, and traffic management in general. 

Haltdos supports pattern scoring on the behalf of the behavior of the packet.
