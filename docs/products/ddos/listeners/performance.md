How to enable and configure caching and compression of responses received?

## Overview

When caching is enabled, DDOS saves responses in a directory and uses them to respond to clients without having to proxy requests for the same content every time and also when compression is enable it provides you the ability to compress or decompress the responses which often significantly reduce the size of transmitted data and increase performance. The compression level is defined based on which responses are compressed to an extent. It also allows configuring other settings for compression.
