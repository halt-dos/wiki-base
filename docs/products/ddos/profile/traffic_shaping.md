# Traffic Shaping

Traffic shaping is a powerful and flexible way to ensure quality of service and defend against bandwidth-abusing distributed denial-of- service (DDoS) attacks.

---

Traffic shaping is a computer network bandwidth management technique that delays some or all data-gram in line with a traffic profile to improve latency, optimize performance, or increase usable bandwidth for certain types of packets by delaying other types.

It support protocols IPv4, IPv6, TCP, UDP, ICMP, IGMP, DNS, SIP, SNMP, NTP, SMTP, IRC, FTP.
