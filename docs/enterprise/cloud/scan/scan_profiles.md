# Scan Profiles

---

## **Overview**

Haltdos Scanner supports multiple scan profiles per target application. A user can create a scan profile and use that to run multiple scans on target applications. The scan profile defines the scope of the security scan, authentication parameters for performing scanning as authenticated user and connection related settings to not overwhelm targeted applications.

A scan profile consists of the following specifications:
