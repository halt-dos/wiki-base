### Records

### Overview

A DNS Record is a database entry that maps a URL to a specified IP address. These records are then stored in the DNS Servers, which can be accessed by different users globally using the URL address. When you search the URL, the browser forwards the URL to the DNS server, and it redirects you to the specific Web server. This web server then serves the site or directs the user to an email server that takes care of the incoming mail.
