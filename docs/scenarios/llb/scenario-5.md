# Scenario 5

LLB configuration under different Scenarios

---
Suppose, there is a organization ABC which is having an firewall configured in HA mode (Active - passive). Organization has a ISP connection with static IP pool.
Organization has two public static IPs which are directly bind with web server located in DMZ zone.

**Haltdos SLB** is placed before the firewall and ISP links are terminating on **Haltdos LLB**. We have configured a different network between the LLB and the firewall.

In the above network diagram, we have configured two standalone Haltdos Link Load Balancer in HA mode (Active - Passive). The ISP links will terminate on LLB will be configured as we have covered in scenario 1 and 2.

To create connection to firewall we need to verify the High availability, hence both of the connection which are connected to firewalls should be configured as a LACP bond.

We will create interface groups and add both links in it to make sure the high availability of the network connectivity of the links.

We have configured the load balancer with 1 ISP connection.

We have configured the SNAT rule for the traffic generated from the LAN users towrads the internet. We can use overload option as well as 'Outgoing Interface IP' option. In overload option, we can select custom static IP from the range provided by the ISP, in case of 'Outgoing Interface IP' all the traffic from LAN users will move to internet using the WAN interface IP address.

For the traffic coming from the client users towards the server located in DMZ. As ISP connection terminated on the Haltdos LLB device, hence we need to configure the Destination NAT rule on LLB device. so that data generated by the client users will be moved to the firewall with the same destination port.

As we have two different public IPs connected to two backend server, hence we will need to create 2nd DNAT rule.

In this way we can acieve the mentioned network deployment.
