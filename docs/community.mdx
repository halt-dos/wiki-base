# Haltdos Community WAF

<div className='gallery'>
  <div className='sub-heading'>
    <p>
      One of its kind, Haltdos brings you user friendly Web application firewall as free to access for all, in the form of Haltdos Community Edition (CE). The Community Edition provides 360 degrees of website security from OWASP 10 threats, XSS, SQL and other web-based threats.
      <br />
      <br />
      Websites have become the primary channel for most businesses to exchange information with customers and stakeholders.
      Different from a Network Firewall, a Web Application Firewall (WAF) filters traffic on internet-facing web applications including APIs.
      A WAF can be especially beneficial to a company that provides an e-commerce site, online financial services, or any other type of web-based product or service involving interactions with customers or business partners. In these cases, WAFs can be especially useful in preventing fraud and data theft.
      <br /><br />
      Haltdos WAF CE allows every website owner the capability to defend their applications against growing cyber attacks and ensure security of their data and customers.
