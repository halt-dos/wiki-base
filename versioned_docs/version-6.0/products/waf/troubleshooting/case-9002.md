# Masking Server Error

---
## Case: 9002

### Problem Statement
Problem: The client is faced with an error handling issue on the application, that leads to the application displaying the internal server information on the web-page. This is a serious cause of concern for the client as exposure of internal server information may attract attackers and leave the application vulnerable.
### Solution

**Steps to Solve**

Implementing WAF error rules to mask the internal server information while the WAF is performing error handling on the fly.

The client can configure the error rules as per his requirements, by setting up an error code along with a custom error page associated to that particular error code.
