Overview of Instance network settings

Haltdos GUI allows users to finely control and configure network settings for all registered instances with the stack. Some of the capability includes configuring IP address, Gateway or creating VLAN and bonding multiple NICs.

Advanced options such as DHCP or configuring advanced routing such as BGP, OSFP, etc. can also be done through GUI.

For more information, go to individual options inside Network Settings.
