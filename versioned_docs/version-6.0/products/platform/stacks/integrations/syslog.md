# Syslog

Integration with Syslog Server for monitoring Haltdos appliances

---

**Syslog** stands for **System Logging Protocol** and is a standard protocol used to send system log or event messages to a specific server, called a **Syslog server**. It is primarily used to collect various device logs from several different machines in a central location for monitoring and review.

**Haltdos** supports integration with 3rd party Syslog service for sending real-time alerts. All logs in **Haltdos** are written in CEF format. The body of the log entry itself is JSON format. This allows simple integration with monitoring tools such as SIEM solutions without the need for writing custom parsers.
