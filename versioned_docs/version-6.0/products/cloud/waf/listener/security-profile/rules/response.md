#### Description

**Rule Name**

Specify a user-friendly name to identify the rule which is to be created. The rule name takes alpha-numeric input.

**Message**

The user can specify a short description of the rule. The description would explain the purpose of the rule.

**Match URI**

Specify the URI for which this rule will be applied. Any requests made on this URI triggers this rule and the respective response shall be filtered according to the rule.

The URI should be a relative URL and in the format: [/home/(*)]

**Search For**

This specifies the value that will be replaced with the search pattern. In order to use the PCRE regex capture group from the search string, use dollar ($) with positions such as $1, $2. 

Note: In order to escape the dollar in the field, use the dollar twice consecutively such as $$.
