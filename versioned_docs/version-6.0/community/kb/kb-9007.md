### **How to add HTTP to HTTPS redirection rule?**

#### **Problem Statement**

Users want to redirect all the HTTP traffic to HTTPS in Haltdos WAF Community Edition.

#### **Solution**

In Haltdos WAF community as well as enterprise edition, users are allowed to make a HTTP to HTTPS redirection rule. This rule will match all the traffic coming as HTTP request will be redirected to HTTPS mode. 
Users can make the redirection rule for **Temporary mode** as well as **Permanent mode**.

1. In the first step user need to log in to the Haltdos WAF CE Web UI console using following URL in any web browser.

(https://<'machineIP>:9000)

:::note
User can log in first time with credential which they have set at the time of registering the license.
