# Server Groups

User can select the Load Balancing mechanism and specify Origin Server IPs on this screen

## Overview

To load balance HTTP traffic to a group of servers, first, you need to define the group. Servers in the group are configured using the Servers page. To pass requests to a server group, use Upstream Rules.

This is useful for:

- Autoscaling, when you need to add more servers.

- Backup Server, When all active servers breach the failure 

- Quick Setup, when you need to change upstream server settings such as server weight, active connections, slow start, failure timeouts.

- Monitoring, when you get the state of the server or server group with one command.

### How to Use:

1. Go to **WAF > Zones > Listeners > Server Groups**

2. Click **Add Server Group** and configure details.

3. Click **Save Changes**.
